PUT

```java
public void put(E e) throws InterruptedException {
        if (e == null) throw new NullPointerException();
        // Note: convention in all put/take/etc is to preset local var
        // holding count negative to indicate failure unless set.
        int c = -1;
        Node<E> node = new Node<E>(e);
        final ReentrantLock putLock = this.putLock;
        final AtomicInteger count = this.count;
        putLock.lockInterruptibly();
        try {
            /*
             * Note that count is used in wait guard even though it is
             * not protected by lock. This works because count can
             * only decrease at this point (all other puts are shut
             * out by lock), and we (or some other waiting put) are
             * signalled if it ever changes from capacity. Similarly
             * for all other uses of count in other wait guards.
             */
            while (count.get() == capacity) {
                notFull.await();
            }
            enqueue(node);
            c = count.getAndIncrement();
            if (c + 1 < capacity)
                notFull.signal();
        } finally {
            putLock.unlock();
        }
        if (c == 0)
            signalNotEmpty();
    }
```





POLL

```java
public E poll(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException {
        E x = null;
        int c = -1;
        long nanos = unit.toNanos(timeout);
        final AtomicInteger count = this.count;
        final ReentrantLock takeLock = this.takeLock;
        takeLock.lockInterruptibly();
        try {
            while (count.get() == 0) {
                if (nanos <= 0)
                    return null;
                nanos = notEmpty.awaitNanos(nanos);
            }
            x = dequeue();
            c = count.getAndDecrement();
            if (c > 1)
                notEmpty.signal();
        } finally {
            takeLock.unlock();
        }
        if (c == capacity)
            signalNotFull();
        return x;
    }
```
